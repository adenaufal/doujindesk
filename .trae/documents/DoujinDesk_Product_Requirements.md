## 12. Troubleshooting & FAQ

### 12.1 Common Technical Issues

**Q: The application is not working offline. What should I do?**
A:

1. Check if the service worker is properly registered in browser dev tools
2. Verify that the app was accessed online at least once to cache resources
3. Clear browser cache and reload the application
4. Ensure sufficient storage space (minimum 100MB available)

**Q: Circle applications are not syncing when back online.**
A:

1. Check network connectivity and Supabase status
2. Verify authentication tokens haven't expired
3. Review browser console for sync errors
4. Manually trigger sync from the dashboard sync button

**Q: File uploads are failing during circle registration.**
A:

1. Verify file size is under limits (256KB for circle cut, 512KB for sample works)
2. Check file format is JPG or PNG only
3. Ensure stable internet connection during upload
4. Try compressing images if they're too large

### 12.2 Performance Issues

**Q: The application is running slowly with large datasets.**
A:

1. Implement pagination for circle lists (50 items per page)
2. Use virtual scrolling for large tables
3. Enable data compression in browser settings
4. Clear IndexedDB cache if it exceeds 40MB

**Q: Search functionality is taking too long.**
A:

1. Verify search indexes are properly created
2. Limit search results to 100 items initially
3. Implement debounced search (300ms delay)
4. Use exact match before fuzzy search

### 12.3 User Management Issues

**Q: Staff members cannot access their assigned modules.**
A:

1. Verify role assignments in user management
2. Check if permissions were updated recently
3. Ask user to log out and log back in
4. Review audit logs for permission changes

**Q: Circle representatives cannot edit their approved applications.**
A:

1. Confirm circle status is "approved" not "pending"
2. Check if editing window is still open (closes 2 weeks before event)
3. Verify user is logged in with correct account
4. Review field-specific edit permissions

### 12.4 Data Integrity Issues

**Q: Circle data appears corrupted or missing.**
A:

1. Check recent backup availability
2. Review sync conflict resolution logs
3. Verify database constraints and validation rules
4. Contact technical support for data recovery

**Q: Booth assignments are conflicting or duplicated.**
A:

1. Run booth allocation validation script
2. Check for concurrent assignment operations
3. Review booth capacity and availability
4. Manually resolve conflicts through admin panel

### 12.5 Event-Specific Troubleshooting

**Q: QR code scanning is not working at event entry.**
A:

1. Ensure camera permissions are granted
2. Check lighting conditions and QR code quality
3. Verify ticket validity and status
4. Use manual ticket number entry as backup

**Q: Real-time updates are not appearing during the event.**
A:

1. Check WebSocket connection status
2. Verify event is in "active" status
3. Refresh browser or restart application
4. Switch to manual refresh mode if needed

### 12.6 Emergency Procedures

**Complete System Failure During Event:**

1. Activate offline mode on all staff devices
2. Use printed backup lists for critical operations
3. Document all manual changes for later sync
4. Contact emergency technical support hotline
5. Implement paper-based backup procedures

**Data Loss or Corruption:**

1. Stop all write operations immediately
2. Assess scope of data loss
3. Restore from most recent backup
4. Notify affected users and stakeholders
